# How it works!!!
Neural coreference resolution models usually involve various components, such as:
<ol>
  <li><b>Feature Extraction:</b> Detecting the different parts of a sentence and their relationships with each other.</li>
  <li><b>Mention Detection:</b>Identifying potential words or phrases (mentions) that may be involved in coreference relations (they all refer to the same entity).</li>
